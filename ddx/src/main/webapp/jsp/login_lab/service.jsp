        This Agreement dated Mon, 30 Jun 2014 20:22:35 -0600 is by and between
        you ("Client") and Henry Schein Practice Solutions, Inc. ("HSPS").
    </li>
    <li>
        HSPS will provide Client with access to the DDX technology platform, which
        enables participating practices and laboratories to communicate digitally
        (the "DDX Services"), subject to the terms and conditions of the License
        Agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Note: The DDX Annual Access Fee entitles you to DDX application enhancements
        and access to the DDX Service for a one-year period (which automatically
        for successive one-year periods unless cancelled in writing 30 days prior
        to the expiration of the initial or any renewal period). While HSPS intends
        to provide enhancements for the DDX application, the timing and content
        of any enhancements cannot be guaranteed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Certified DDX Training is designed to help you and your staff understand
        and utilize DDX. HSPS's experience is that offices which complete training
        see accelerated profit and increased productivity. Accordingly, HSPS recommends
        that Client purchase at least one day of training. Training is conducted
        at Client's lab by a Certified DDX Trainer. HSPS discourages training conducted
        by persons who are not Certified DDX Trainers. Certified DDX Trainers are
        independent contractors. HSPS warrants only that the Trainer met HSPS's
        requirements to be, and has been, certified to teach. Pricing does not
        include travel expenses.
    </li>
    <li>
        I have read the agreement in its entirety, including the Fees and Payment
        Terms, and I understand and accept all of the provisions stated herein.
        I personally and unconditionally guarantee payment of all debts incurred
        for products, services and other fees rendered by Henry Schein Practice
        Solutions, Inc. I have the authority to make purchases for Client.

                necessary to perform the obligations hereunder, (ii) cooperate with HSPS
                in providing the services hereunder; and (iii) pay the entire balance of

                    Fees and Payment Terms.
                </strong>
                HSPS agrees to provide the DDX Services to Client at the initial fees
                indicated and Client agrees to pay HSPS for the DDX Services in accordance
                with the terms of this Agreement. All fees are exclusive of any state,
                local and other taxes and charges (other than income or franchise taxes
                payable by HSPS) directly applicable to the DDX Services. All fees due
                under this Agreement shall be payable by Client within 30 days after sign
                up. Fees remitted after such 30-day period shall bear interest at 1.5%
                per month or, if less, the maximum rate permitted by law. Fees are subject
                to change at the sole discretion of HSPS at any time. Such change in fees
                shall become effective for Client on the earlier of (i) the 60th day after
                notice to Client of a change in fees or (ii) at the beginning of the succeeding
                Renewal Term; provided that Client shall have the right following notice
                of the change in fees but prior to the effective date of such change to
                terminate this Agreement. All amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars and
                all payments shall be made in U.S. dollars.

                        and Client, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety,
                        constitutes the entire agreement between Client and HSPS regarding the
                        DDX Services. All prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, understandings
                        and communications between or involving Client and HSPS, whether oral or
                        written, regarding the DDX Services are superseded by this Agreement. The
                        terms contained in this Agreement shall supersede any conflicting terms
                        contained in any purchase order, invoice or other document used or submitted
                        by either party in connection with the purchase of the DDX Services covered
                        by this Agreement and HSPS shall not be bound by any provisions of any
                        purchase order, receipt, acceptance, confirmation, correspondence, or otherwise,
                        unless HSPS specifically agrees to the provision in writing. Except for
                        the Terms of Use for the DDX Website, this Agreement may not be amended,
                        nor any obligation waived, except by a writing signed by both parties.

                        hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
                        exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
                        exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

                        If any provision herein is otherwise held to be invalid or unenforceable
                        for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without
                        being impaired or invalidated in any way. The parties agree to replace
                        any invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates
                        the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision.

                        lists, marketing materials and otherwise, the identity of Client as a client
                        of HSPS and display Client's logo on its web site. Neither party shall
                        issue a general press release naming the other party or regarding the existence
                        of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party;
                        provided, however, that either party may, without such consent, make any
                        press release or other public announcement as required by law.
