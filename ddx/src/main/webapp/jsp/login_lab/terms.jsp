    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        ii. In the event the Business Associate determines that the returning
        of or destroying of the PHI is infeasible, Business Associate shall provide

        infeasible, and thereafter, Business Associate shall extend the protections
        of this Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of
        such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible,
